Several leaders of the BJP also made the point that allies were upset at the misuse of investigative agencies against political rivals, even allies, to make them more \"amenable\". While every government at the centre has done this, it seems to have reached a nadir&nbsp;under the Modi government.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Sena leaders told me that Thackeray felt bullied and humiliated by the BJP in the past six years.

That is the implication of a new research paper by economists Ran Abramitzky, Leah Platt Boustan, Elisa Jacome and Santiago Perez.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">Using historical Census data to compare the incomes of immigrant fathers and their native-born sons, the economists found that the second generation has been just as capable of moving up the economic ladder in recent decades as they were a century ago. Looking at second-generation American men whose immigrant fathers were at the 25th percentile of income - in other words, fairly poor - they found that they tend to climb higher than their poor counterparts whose fathers were born in the US.&nbsp;And for most countries the researchers could measure, immigrant upward mobility is greater now than it was a century ago:<img src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-11/509saju_immigrants-bloomberg_625x300_11_November_19.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px;\"></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">Almost all children of recent immigrants tend to be more upwardly mobile than people whose parents were born in the US. That isn\"t surprising, since immigrants often have limited English skills and lack personal networks in the country; their children, who don\"t suffer these disadvantages, naturally tend to move up to an income level more commensurate with their ambition and abilities. Furthermore, immigrants tend to move to places where upward mobility is easier, like big cities and college towns.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">But immigrants from some countries are especially mobile:</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\"><img src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-11/i6id9k1_immigrants-bloomberg_625x300_11_November_19.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px;\"></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">The average second-generation Indian- or Chinese-American who grew up on the edge of poverty will tend to reach the upper-middle class. That level of upward mobility is simply amazing. For Indian-Americans, the phenomenon is particularly surprising, since most Indian immigrants already speak English when they arrive, and hence have less of a handicap relative to their native-born kids.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">Why do Indian and Chinese immigrants do so well? Some will no doubt attribute their outperformance to cultural values of education and hard work. In reality, it\"s probably more about the type of immigrants who come from those countries. Indian and Chinese people tend to come to the U.S. not as refugees or unauthorized low-wage laborers, but as high-skilled workers or the close relatives of skilled workers. That means even poor Indian and Chinese immigrants tend to have prosperous friends and relatives, and to come from families that value education and ambition. And India and China have by far the biggest pools of population from which to select such driven and talented individuals.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">This is especially true for India. Even in comparison with other high-achieving groups, Indian-Americans stand out in terms of education level and dominance in high-skilled occupations:</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\"><img src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-11/nqampl68_immigrants-bloomberg_625x300_11_November_19.jpg\" style=\"width: 488px;\"></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">As a result, Indians are the highest-earning group by ancestry in the US, with a median household income of more than $110,000 in 2016 (the difference isn\"t due to larger households, since Indian-Americans also come out on top in terms of per capita income). But it\"s not just scientific and technical fields in which Indian-Americans excel. They are increasingly a force in politics and law. A growing number of politicians, top political staffers and judges are of Indian descent. In business, too, Indians are rocketing to the top -- two of the US\"s five biggest companies, Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., have Indian-born chief executive officers. Though historical comparisons are hard, Indians seem on track to be the most accomplished minority group in US&nbsp;history.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">This is not to say that all Indian-Americans are successful; some are poor. Nor should Indian achievement be used as a reason to denigrate other lower-skilled immigrant groups. The point, rather, is that the US could benefit by letting in more Indian immigrants.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">Employer-sponsored permanent residence permits, or green cards, are parceled out by country. There are about 150,00 available each year; officially, only 7 per cent&nbsp;of these green cards can be given to immigrants from any one country in a given year, though some countries\" unused spots can be given to other countries. This system is deeply biased against big countries like India and China. In 2018, more than half of employment-based green card requests were for Indians, but Indians received only 13 per cent&nbsp;of the total.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 16px;\">One solution is to simply remove the country cap.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman making her side of the government secretariat out of bounds for reporters naturally made even those like us who cover the Home Ministry on the other side of the North Block feel threatened.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">But reassurance came from the highest level - Home Minister Amit Shah himself. He said he would not restrict entry for his beat reporters. \"I am a large-hearted person. I don\"t impose such restrictions,\" he told a group of reporters. This decision of the minister has been applauded by every reporter on my beat.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Normally, reporters are the most-criticised lot in any news office.

It also goes on to show the level of confidence the new minister has in tackling tricky questions from reporters. Many of us feel it\"s after a long time that we have a home minister who is so open and clear in his views.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Among reporters, it\"s often accepted that&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">netas</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">babus</em>&nbsp;who shy away from the media don\"t have confidence in their abilities.

Both are supremely confident, clear on what and how they want as policy and both are sure of their facts. both have intimidating personalities but are always surrounded by journalists. Both also monitor the media very closely.<img src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-06/q1suq38g_amit-shah-as-home-minister-pti-650_625x300_03_June_19.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px;\"></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">Home Minister Amit Shah&nbsp;had assured reporters that he would not put restrictions on their entry</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Officers in the ministry disclose that like Mr Chidambaram, even Amit Shah reads files and papers marked to him to the last detail.

This is important as we were often left clueless during the tenure of the two other recent home ministers - Sushil Kumar Shinde and Rajnath Singh. Both trusted reporters who covered the party more than the reporters who covered the ministry.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Officers who have worked and are still working in the Home Ministry state that despite similar working styles, both ministers approach issues very differently because of the ideologies they follow. Be it the issue of Kashmir, Naxalism or the North East - three core areas of the Home Ministry - the two have different approach.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Amit Shah has the added advantage of being a trusted aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi; no one dares to negate him on any issue.

That is why Delhi NCR and much of north India is struggling to breathe. And all the players are equally to blame as they try, cleverly (or so they think), and pass the buck. Add to the cauldron a Delhi election around the corner and you can be sure it isn\"t concern for your health that is driving the politics of fighting pollution.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">While Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has tried to position himself as the man trying to save our lungs, with claims that pollution in Delhi is down 25 per cent, his odd-even scheme is completely fake. It only targets cars, leaving seven million two-wheelers to spew their dirt. That two-wheelers are responsible for 25 per cent of vehicular pollution (twice that of cars) cuts no ice with him, nor does the fact that two-wheelers intrinsically create more pollution per horse power than cars. But who can blame him; there are more two-wheeler-owning voters around and he needs those votes, come 2020.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The simplest way to deal with this crisis would have been to declare public transport free, including our much cherished metro system. That with an odd-even ban on motorcycles, would have helped. But that would need to overcome not just objections over subsiding the metro from the DMRC, but also the central government and the Supreme Court. The court had warned the Delhi Government against tinkering with the financial health of the metro system when Delhi wanted to introduce free carriage for women. The Supreme Court has much concern about pollution in the capital and needs to take a more holistic view on the DMRC and not just its finances.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"><img src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-11/1tbflvqg_arvind-kejriwal-distributing-antipollution-masks-pti_625x300_04_November_19.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px;\"></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\"><u style=\"\">Arvind Kejriwal has hit back at allegations that his government is playing a \"blame game\" over the air pollution crisis.</u></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The fact is that the metro is overpriced.

Which means it\"s much cheaper (door-to-door) for two people to share a ride on a two-wheeler than take the metro. Its ridership has stagnated under the 3 million-a-day mark despite a doubling on the network. This is actually a financial disaster given the investment in the additional lines. The lack of ridership is clearly linked to the fare, but both DMRC and the centre (co-owners with the Delhi Government), are against subsidising metro fares even though worldwide metros are subsidised.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Then the state and the centre are fighting over the lack of machinery provided to farmers for removing the stubble.

There are certain premises, quite fundamental to the final verdict, which are questionable.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">But a caveat is required.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The reference to the \"Hindu\" side and the \"Muslim\" side should be seen as reference only to the parties in the suit and not referring to these parties as representing their respective communities. We know that there are substantial sections of Hindus who are appalled by the actions which have gone on in their name. Within the Muslim community too, there are different views. Therefore the reference is only in so far as the judgement refers to the parties in this manner.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The basic question which is troubling is that after the judgement accepts that the demolition of the mosque in 1992 and the placing of the idols in 1949 were \"serious violations of the law\", why does the court reward the serious violators of the law by handing over the entire land to them? Are there any overwhelming issues which would support such a decision? The judgement does not provide any convincing reasons.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The judgement acknowledged, though perhaps inadvertently, the political dimensions. One of the reasons given while rejecting the Allahabad High Court judgement mandating division of the disputed land into three equal parts was that it \"will not restore a lasting sense of peace and tranquility.\" Therefore, one can assume that the Supreme Court believed one of the aims of its judgement must be to \"restore a lasting sense of peace and tranquility.\" This would be based more on a political assessment rather than one based on legal issues.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Till just a few days before the judgement was made public, when the Prime Minister and others appealed for calm and stated that all should accept the judgement, top leaders of the ruling regime were aggressively campaigning for the Ram temple in the precise place where the Babri Masjid once stood. They made it clear enough that \"lasting tranquility\" would be elusive in a scenario other than what the judgement actually delivered. One cannot escape the reality that there is a political dimension as a premise of this judgement which influences everything else.<br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\"><br style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">The judgement was at pains to distance itself from arguments in which \"faith\" trumps reason. It said \"the court does not decide title on the basis of faith or belief but on the basis of evidence.\" It rejected the recognition of the Ram Janmasthan as a legal entity. It said if such a claim were to be accepted \"the extinguishing of competing claims on land would arise not by virtue of settled legal principles, but purely on the basis of the faith and belief of devotees.\"</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">But on this very issue the judgement appears self-contradictory. In deciding the critical aspect of adverse possession of the disputed land, the court applied differing standards in judging claims of the opposing sides.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The mosque was built in 1528. Between 1528 and 1856 who was in possession? The judgement says, \"The Muslims have offered no evidence to indicate that that they were in exclusive possession of the inner structure prior to 1857, since the date of the construction in the sixteenth century.\"</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">This is a rather odd conclusion. Between 1528 and 1722, the entire area was under the Mughals, after which it was under the Nawabs of Awadh. In 1856 it was annexed by the British. The first dispute was registered subsequently.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">It is self-evident that in the entire period under Muslim rule, when the land is in their possession, it is Muslims who would be praying at the mosque, what further evidence is required? The Hindu side could not provide any evidence of exclusive possession of the outer courtyard either but this was not taken as an issue. Thus, the issue of inequality in the standards used to judge the claims of both sides.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The judgement says \"the physical structure of an Islamic mosque did not shake the faith and belief of Hindus that Lord Ram was born at the disputed site\" -&nbsp;and this becomes the reason for a sleight of hand that since the Muslims could not prove exclusive possession, in the \"preponderance of probability\" the Hindus continued to pray there and this therefore establishes the right of Hindus to the disputed land.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The Muslim side never asked for land. Their main plea was that the mosque and the title of the land where it stood belonged to them on the ground of possession. Once that was rejected by the court, if indeed Article 142 was to be used, could it not have been used to immediately order a time frame to punish those responsible for the demolition of the mosque? Those cases have been pending for the last 27 years. But there is no suggestion by the Court to expedite those cases.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Of course there are many quotable quotes and important formulations which serve the interests of secularism and may be used in the future. The point, for example, that the judgement, in spite of referring to the ASI excavation findings, concludes that there is no proof that there was a temple underneath the mosque, nor that the structure had been destroyed to build the mosque. In a way, this knocks the bottom out of the claim made by temple campaigners that since a&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">Mandir</em>&nbsp;was demolished to build a mosque, the historical wrong must be redressed. The judgement also makes it clear that \"the law cannot be used as a device to reach back in time and provide a legal remedy to every person who disagrees with the course which history has taken. This also goes against the present attempts by sections of the&nbsp;<em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">mandir</em>&nbsp;campaigners that the judgement can be used as a precedent for other sites.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The judgement also refers to basic values of secularism etc. It approvingly mentions the Protection of Religious Places of Worship Act 1991. But there are serious issues in the judgement, some of which have been elaborated here, which cannot be overlooked.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.</em></p><div class=\"comment_story\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; float: right; position: relative; width: 90px; height: 60px; margin: 7px 0px 15px 15px; display: table; background: rgb(50, 104, 145); border-radius: 5px; text-align: center; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-transform: uppercase; opacity: 0.5; transition: all 0.3s ease-in 0s; transform: scale(1);\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle;\"><span class=\"ndtv-detailp-comments-count\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; display: block; padding: 5px;\">172 COMMENTS</span></span></div><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"><a class=\"showFilePanel\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(50, 104, 145) !important;\"></a></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\">Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

We have seen in this country and elsewhere that leaders often claim innocence on the ground that they have won their election. Popular mandate does not mean obliteration of all illegalities committed by them.

Joseph de Maestre, a French thinker of the 18th century said \"every nation gets the government it deserves\". \"It also gets the Opposition it deserves;\" I may add. More than the shenanigans of the government of the day, it is the opposition parties which are failing the people. They are in complete disarray after their loss in the Lok Sabha elections. They are a dispirited, demoralised lot with no will to fight the government either in parliament or on the streets. They consider their duty done by tweeting or commenting on Facebook or other social media platforms. They no longer go out to the people. Their leaders have lost their élan.</p><div id=\"checked\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"><div class=\"teads-adCall\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\"></div><div id=\"adslotNativeVideo\" data-google-query-id=\"CNCLoMCh6eUCFQeHaAodk4EL8Q\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; text-align: center; padding-bottom: 20px;\"><div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/1068322/NDTV_News_ROS_Native_Outstream_0__container__\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; border: 0pt none;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/1068322/NDTV_News_ROS_Native_Outstream_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/1068322/NDTV_News_ROS_Native_Outstream_0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" data-google-container-id=\"6\" data-load-complete=\"true\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; border-width: 0px; border-style: initial; vertical-align: bottom;\"></iframe></div></div></div><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Even the surprising results of the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections have failed to raise their spirits.

Accordingly, the expectation of a person is one of responsibilities and duties rather than ‘rights’.  As Judaism&nbsp;recognises&nbsp;that a child does not have the cognitive ability to fully distinguish good from evil, the parent has the ultimate responsibility of guiding the child in keeping with the words in Deuteronomy, “And you shall teach them – the words of God – to your children in order that you may lengthen your days and your children’s days upon the earth.” Similarly, a proverb says, “Listen my child to the instruction of your parents.”&nbsp;Thus&nbsp;the sacredness of human life is applied to the infant as soon as he is born. As a logical consequence of this conception, each child is entitled to be loved and cared for in order that he develops to his maximum potential.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin: 20px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; color: rgb(43, 43, 43); font-family: Lato, sans-serif;\"><img src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SpeakingTree-new-Logo-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 740px;\"><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><br></span></p><div class=\"content\" style=\"overflow-wrap: break-word; margin-top: 5px; clear: both; color: rgb(43, 43, 43); font-family: Lato, sans-serif;\"><p style=\"margin: 20px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">ewish Law specifies the rights of children which are the primary obligation of the natural parents, but which in the latter’s absence, incapacity or failure, become the responsibility of the community. These include not only the right to life, dignity and freedom but also to be provided with the skills to survive natural dangers as well as to earn a living and be self-sustaining. They also include the right to establish an independent marital home upon reaching maturity as well as property rights.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin: 20px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">The Talmud says that while the most basic needs that parents and the community must provide for children are those of food, clothing and protection, education is necessary, that teaches moral and ethical values by which children learn to live a holy, spiritual and moral life and subsequently pass on the heritage to future generations. In Judaism, the abuse of children is prohibited even to parents and teachers with good intention. “One must not hurt them physically with hard toil, nor their feelings with hard speech. Whoever irritates them, provokes them to anger, pains them, persecutes them, or causes them loss of money is guilty of serious transgression, and&nbsp;all the more&nbsp;if one beats them.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin: 20px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">Parents are morally bound to impart holistic education to their children because holistic education is the integration of our physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual personality, achieved by inculcating the purity of heart and serenity of mind to perceive the world in the right perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin: 20px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">Judaism&nbsp;recognises&nbsp;that the wellbeing of society&nbsp;as a whole is&nbsp;determined by how it treats its children.

Judaism makes it very clear that the extent to which we respond to a child’s needs is the extent to which we are loyal to our own religious identities.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">&nbsp;</span></p></div><p style=\"margin: 20px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; color: rgb(43, 43, 43); font-family: Lato, sans-serif;\"><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></span></p><div class=\"disclaimer\" style=\"padding: 12.5469px 0px; font-size: 12px; color: grey; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif;\">DISCLAIMER : Views expressed above are the author\"s own</div>', '2019-11-15', 18),
(17, 'Delhi\"s \"Pink Ticket\" Scheme Is More Than Just A Free Bus Ride', '<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); display: inline; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Last week, the Delhi Government rolled out a travel scheme that offers free rides to women in over 5,500 state-run buses in the national capital. This decision by the AAP government has the potential to transform the socio-economic status of women in our society, with increased access to public spaces and improved participation in the workforce.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 15px 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The ability of women to move freely has been restricted globally in various domains. Freedom of movement is not only a human right - emphasized in the Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - but is also an economic imperative. It is important to note that restriction on movement of women is not limited to a legal imposition. When we have social and economic norms that make mobility to workplace difficult or fail to protect women from sexual harassment in public places, we are indeed restricting their freedom to move. We are ergo impairing them in terms of economics, freedom and human rights.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">India ranks 121 among 131 countries in female labour force participation rate averaging at 23 per cent. At 17 per cent of GDP, the economic contribution of Indian women is less than half the global average. Women\"s workforce participation rate in Delhi is shamefully low at 11 per cent, which is even below the national average. Increasing this participation is paramount not only for gender equality but also for national economic progress. A prominent way to achieve this is through increasing freedom of mobility for women.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-11/rft8pta_delhi-women-bus-ride-twitter_625x300_03_November_19.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px;\"></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); font-size: 12px; color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\"><u style=\"\">India ranks 121 among 131 countries in female labour force participation rate averaging at 23 per cent.</u></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">A move like the one adopted in Delhi, whereby women can travel for free in the buses is therefore a revolutionary yet necessary one. In a deeply unequal country like ours, where women still have to take money from their fathers, husbands and sons for every small expense, free bus travel will give women independence to move freely and save monetarily. These in turn increase women\"s decision-making abilities and empower them. The inclusion of bus marshals to ensure protection of the commuting women further advances their mobility.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Instead of referring to theoretical studies on the relationship between increased mobility and empowerment of women, let me give real life examples that I came across either in person, on social media or in popular media since Tuesday. An outlet spoke of a 29-year-old woman who is the sole bread-earner for herself and her elderly parents. When talking of the scheme, she said that though the saved bus fee seems like a small amount in general, for her - a daily commuter - the saving aggregates to almost&nbsp;<span class=\"rupee\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: RupeeForadianRegular !important;\">R<span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; left: -9999em; position: absolute; text-indent: -9999em;\">s.</span></span>&nbsp;15,600 in a year.

That accounts for 21 per cent of her income! The percentage of her monthly budget, which she would earlier spend on transport, was three times the percentage of the national budget allocated to education..

They are mobile without monetary restrictions, and have already become aware of how much they will save and where they now want to invest that saved money. This is indeed a historic move in the field of women empowerment, and it is so heart-warming to see the joy on women\"s faces as they show their \"pink ticket\" for free travel.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">While the United Nations Human Rights Committee concurred that \"Liberty of movement is an indispensable condition for the free development of a person,\" the Delhi model has become one of the first 100 cities globally to apply this belief in a literal sense - in the transport sector for women. The rationale for doing so is simple and is printed on the \"pink ticket\" in the hands of all women who have used buses in Delhi - \"When women progress, the country progresses.\"</p>', '2019-11-18', 19);

It has been around since 1991 when the Narasimham Committee recommended merging PSU banks in a three-tiered structure by size. In 1993, there was a messy merger of the cash-strapped New Bank of India with Punjab National Bank. Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram was a great votary of bank mergers, ostensibly to give government banks a fighting chance to compete against foreign players. Two of SBI\"s associate banks, the State Bank of Saurashtra and State Bank of Indore, were merged with the parent in the UPA years.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">While the UPA drew up the plans for bigger mergers, it was the Modi government which implemented them. In 2017, SBI\"s five associate banks and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank were merged with the parent. In April this year, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank were merged with Bank of Baroda. And, now, a series of mega mergers have created four big government banks.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">What is it that the government wants to achieve? Two key things - reducing bad loans and increasing lending activity. The first will give banks the confidence to lend and the second will hopefully revive investments in the economy. The mergers appear to have been done keeping two related banking ratios in mind. One is the percentage of bad loans (NPA ratio) and the other, the amount of cheap funds that banks can access for lending (CASA ratio).</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The rest of it involves so-called economies of scale. Multi-state presence and thousands of branches are meant to streamline the operations of these merged government banks. Of course, economies of scale also mean taking a close look at costs to improve the financials of these banks.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">The elephant in the room here is public sector bank employees. Will there be job losses? Or even if there isn\"t any large-scale retrenchment, do these mergers mean that the rate of new hiring will drop sharply? Bank employees are worried about their jobs and the future of their career. That\"s why the Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) has already called for a strike on Saturday evening. (Do they really work on Saturday evenings?)</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Could the government have dealt with the bad loans crisis in some other way? Banks have to set aside some funds every time a loan goes bad. This is called \"provisioning\" and it eats into a bank\"s capital. So, being saddled with large amounts of bad loans has whittled away the capital of government-owned banks. The answer to this has been recapitalising them.</p><p><div id=\"checked\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\"></div></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">The central government had already given<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"rupee\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: RupeeForadianRegular !important;\">R<span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; left: -9999em; position: absolute; text-indent: -9999em; font-family: RupeeForadianRegular !important;\">s.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>2.46 lakh crore to recapitalise banks and is now releasing another<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"rupee\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: RupeeForadianRegular !important;\">R<span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; left: -9999em; position: absolute; text-indent: -9999em; font-family: RupeeForadianRegular !important;\">s.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>70,000 crore.

Another reason is that nothing has been done to remove external bottlenecks that hold back viable infrastructure projects.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">What should have been done is to spend government money to provide more capital to state-owned banks. Along with that, the government should have taken over private projects and ensured they are operated viably by public sector companies. Don\"t forget that the Supreme Court recently puts its trust in a government company, NBCC, to complete projects that a private player couldn\"t finish.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Of course, spending more money would require either raising more revenue through taxes on those who can pay, or funding it through an enlarged fiscal deficit. Till now, this government hasn\"t shown any inclination of taking on the ingrained fiscal fundamentalism in India\"s public discourse. So, no one is holding their breath.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Ultimately, the merger of these public sector banks is meant to turn them into lean and mean giants - all muscle, no fat. It is another clear assertion that the state has abdicated its role in ensuring that finance flows in an equitable manner. It is a complete reversal of why banks were nationalised 50 years ago. The objective is to run government banks in the same way as private banks are - to just make profits.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">It also signals that the government wants to gradually get out of this problematic process of ensuring credit to the poor. Jan Dhan notwithstanding, the Modi Sarkar appears to be setting the stage for privatizing some of India\"s big public sector banks. A few sickly financial institutions will probably be maintained by the state to enable vote-winning cash transfers.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;\">Bank recapitalisation and mergers are an attempt to clean up the mess created by excessive lending during the UPA years. It would be alright if the final goal was to increase public control over the country\"s finances. The problem is that it might just end up being a way for government banks to first bail out rich private creditors and then be sold to big private players.</p>', '2019-11-18', 19);
